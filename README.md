# Measure Net Neutrality

Measure Net Neutrality is a project designed to parse, clean (in a statistical way : remove outliers for example) and analyse data about Net Neutrality. The goal of this project is also to give access to data in a open format, like CSV, to encourage people to reuse these open data (instead of having to parse row data).

Data supported :

* Now, I have developed scripts only for data of Shaperprobe, a software designed to detect traffic shaping. See these scripts : https://github.com/Framartin/MeasureNetNeutrality/tree/master/MLab/ShaperProbe
* I want to include more data from the [MeasurementLab](http://www.measurementlab.net/tests). The MLab is a platform hosting an enormous amount (960 TB corresponding to 385 millions tests in september 2014) of data coming from software measuring performance or neutrality of Internet connections. All data are available under the CC-0 license.
