# Measure Net Neutrality

Measure Net Neutrality is a project designed to parse, clean and analyze data about Net Neutrality.

These scripts are intended to be executed automatically once a week. Then, we generate an updated statistical analysis report in a HTML/CSS presentation using reaveal.js. See the [example](https://github.com/Framartin/MeasureNetNeutrality/tree/master/MLab/ShaperProbe/StatisticalAnalysis/example).

The goal of this project is also to give access to data in a open format to encourage people to reuse these open data.


The objective is to present as many data sets as possible. But for now we only support Shaperprobe, a software designed to detect traffic shaping.
See [the scripts folder for more details](https://github.com/Framartin/MeasureNetNeutrality/tree/master/MLab/ShaperProbe).

In the future, we will include more data from the [MeasurementLab](http://www.measurementlab.net/tests). The MLab is a platform hosting an enormous amount (960 TB corresponding to 385 millions tests in September 2014) of data coming from software measuring performance or neutrality of Internet connections. All data are available under the CC-0 license.
